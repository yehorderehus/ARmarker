# ARmarker tool application development
This project is aimed at replacing ArUco and ORB markers, both from OpenCV, with 3d models via OpenGL. A user sees it in front of himself if uses a camera to detect the marker, or it can be done by replacing uploaded media - thus achieving the effect of augmented reality. 

## Functionality
- [x] **Camera stream and gallery support**. Marker recognition on the provided source
- [x] **Marker replacement with images**. Not only images but also videos and gifs
- [ ] **3d models display**. Stable visualization in the space above the marker
- [ ] **Capturing and storing frames**. Make a screenshot or video and access it
- [ ] **Catalogue of objects**. Select from basic ones or upload your own
- [ ] **Uploading and selection of ARmarkers**. They are based on ORB, and have to be handled - after an image with the marker is uploaded, it can be detected. Nothing prevents you from using built-in ArUco markers instead
- [ ] **Detailed About description and Git Wiki**. Complete information on How to use and project information
